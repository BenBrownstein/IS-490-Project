            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>This is a group project I did with three other classmates at the begining of my time in the BASIS program. It has a homepage and then each team member has their own personal portfolio page.</p>
            <p>Javascript has been implemented into the site with some basic functionality there is a rock, paper, scissors game in my page. This project is the inspiration for this site.</p>
            <p>This project is completed. There are some lines of code that I can see myself going back to and using again like the nav bar and some of the CSS.</p>
