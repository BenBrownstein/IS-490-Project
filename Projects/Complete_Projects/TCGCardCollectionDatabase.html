            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>Using SQL and PHP I created a website that stores the info for cards from Magic The Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh. The cards are stored in an SQL database which is accessed by the PHP code.</p>
            <p>There is account creation, account deletion, and password updating for users. Users can store cards from the database into a personalized collection.</p>
            <p>Cards are sorted by Game and then further broken down into as much detail as possible. This will show when users look into the cards info and are search parameters.</p>
            <p>The project is complete at this point. More cards and games could be added based on the framework already created but it would be a better use of time to use an API to get the card info instead of manually adding them.</p>
