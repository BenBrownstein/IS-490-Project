            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>I am learning Ruby to create a PDF Multitool. The features of the Multitool are that it can join PDF files, split PDF files, remove a section of a PDF files, convert the contents of a PDF file to a txt file, and make a fillable box on the file</p>
            <p>The second set of feautres is the automation which monitors two different folder. The first folder is the Combine All which whenever a PDF file enters the folder it joins it to all of the other files in the folder in the order they were added. This is the combined.pdf file that is in the Output Folder. The Make Plain Text will when a PDF file is placed in the folder convert the contents of the file to a txt file and name it Plain_Text_filename and place it in the Output Folder.</p>
            <p>At this point in time the progress on the project is mostly done I just need to clean up the code and add more comments.</p>
