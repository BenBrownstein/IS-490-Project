            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>I am using this to store any Python code I work on individually. I am also storing all of the Datacamp certificates for the course I have completed in it in this repo as they all used Python.</p>
            <p>Most of the Python Coding I have done has been mob coding in lab so I do not have many examples.</p>
            <p>This project is mostly complete but I could see myself adding more to it overtime.</p>
